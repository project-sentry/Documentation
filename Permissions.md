## What are permissions?
Permissions are important for the normal function of any bot, it gives you the abillity to control the actions and abillities of users within a specific role. These can be configured per Channel, or as vauge as per Role.

## Why does Sentry require these "basic" permissions?
Sentry is a Moderation Bot, and as with many Moderation Bots, the abillity to View Channels, Send Messages, Manage Messages, and Read Message History is critical to doing the basic functions of Message Logging. Logging these basic functions gives some protection to ensure messages are not being used to communicate illegal activity, or other things that violate Discord Terms of Service.

## Why does Sentry suggest the Administrator permission?
The Administrator permission is the permission of choice when it comes to all bots asking to join your server. It gives the bot **total** access. Making all abillities tied to into a single role. But, be careful who and what you give this permission to as it can be used to "nuke" or be malicious to your server.
The reason behind Sentry needing this permission, is it gives Sentry total access. To Ban, Kick, Mute, Move, and much more moderation features that reduce the manual moderation load on staff. Giving Sentry the abillity to AutoMod the majority of the server.
